# Pure Rust Encryption Apps

(no deps allowed!) 


Truly safe crypto “with no dependencies” is a trap. The Rust standard library has no cryptography, so the moment you don’t pull in vetted crates you’re forced to hand‑roll primitives, which is inherently risky. The safest real‑world answer is to use audited crates (e.g., chacha20poly1305, argon2, getrandom) and keep your code surface small. NEVERTHELESS- sometimes its fun to code in rust with no dependencies !!
